# Robotic Design Elements
Sweeper:  Pneumatic cylinder on each side used to push wings out. || 
Launcher (Common): Motors used to draw back rubber bands, or spinners used to thrust the balls out. || 
Picker  (Common). || 
Drive Train: Either 4 motor 4 wheel or 4 motor 6 wheel. || 
Elevation Mechanism: Pneumatic lifting mechanism, 2 pistsons would generate about 24 pounds of force with a 2 in stroke. The retraction would have decreased force, the retraction would most likely have around 10 pounds of force each so 20 total. || 
Average weight of a bot 8-24 pounds. Most are in the range of 12-16, however there are a few that are extremes of 8 lb to 24+ lb.

# Autonomous Period Win Point
  Removed triball from load zone.
  Scored at least on alliance triball on alliance goal.
  Ended the autonomous period contacting their own elevation bar.
