# Robotic Design Elements
Sweeper
    Pneumatic cylinder on each side used to push wings out.
Launcher (Common)
    Motors used to draw back rubber bands, or spinners used to thrust the balls out.
Picker  (Common)
Either 4 motor 4 wheel or 4 motor 6 wheel.

  Pneumatic lifting mechanism, 2 pistons would generate about 24 pounds of force with a 2 in stroke. However , the most         important part for us (retraction) would be less.
  
Average weight of a bot 8-24 pounds. 
# Autonomous Period Win Point
  Removed triball from load zone.
  Scored at least on alliance triball on alliance goal.
  Ended the autonomous period contacting their own elevation bar.
